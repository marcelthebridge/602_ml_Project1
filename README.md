# Wine Wizard ML
Project to create digital sommelier from red wine dataset and utilizing ML techniques


## Overview
* Not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars or dozens of hours learning to discern quality wine, this project is hoping to open the door 
* Contents
  * [EDA and first looks](Project_1_Technical.ipynb)
  * [Streamlined Report](Project_1_Report.ipynb)
  * [Red Wine Dataset](winequality-red.csv)
  * [README](README.md)
  
## Goals
  * Create a model to help predict **quality** wines based on wine composition (see features below)
  * [Deliver a fantastic video presentation (click here)](https://youtu.be/nQ-182cjVF0)

## Data
* Fixed acidity
    * Acids found within wines which do not evaporate readily
* Volatile acidity
    * Acectic acid levels.  Higher levels lead to a vinegary taste
* Citric acid
    * Can add a sort of 'freshness' to wines
* Residual sugar
    * Sugar that persists after fermentation.  Typically between 1 g/L and 45 g/L
* Chlorides
    * Salts
* Free sulfur dioxide
    * Free form of SO2.  Prevents microbial growth and oxidation.
    * Total sulfur dioxide
    * Amount of Free and Bound forms of SO2. Higher levels become evident in smell/taste of wine
* Density
    * Relationship of water, alcohol, and sugar
* pH
    * Measure of acidic or basic on a scale of 0-14. Most wines range from 3-4.
* Sulphates
    * Additive which contribues to SO2 levels.  
* Aclohol
    * Alcohol percentage
* Quality
    * A scale of 0-10.  Wines below 8 may be considered **bad** wines
